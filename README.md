# Clusterisation
My study projects on clusterisation topic

K-means:<br>
&ensp; My attempt to write my own k-means function.<br>
&ensp;  Tests were done on iris_dataset from sklearn.datasets giving homage to Ronald Fisher.<br>
&ensp;  (More information about iris flowers dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
 
&ensp; Trying to write as short function as possible =).<br>
&ensp; I would be glad to get any comments.
