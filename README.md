# Clusterisation
My study projects on clusterisation topic

K-means:
 My attempt to write my own k-means function.
 Tests were done on iris_dataset from sklearn.datasets giving homage to Ronald Fisher.
 (More information about iris flowers dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
 
 Trying to write as short function as possible =).
 I would be glad to get any comments.
